Welcome to the **Advanced Rocket Simulator**, a powerful and interactive simulation tool designed to model rocket trajectories with precision. Built using Python, PyQt5, and Matplotlib, this application leverages the Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) method for accurate numerical integration. Whether you're an aerospace enthusiast, a student, or a professional, this simulator offers an intuitive interface and robust features to visualize and analyze rocket dynamics.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: A sleek and user-friendly interface built with PyQt5.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Input fields for thrust, mass, specific impulse, launch angle, and environmental conditions.
- **Advanced Numerical Integration**: Implements the RK4 method for precise simulation of rocket trajectories.
- **Multiple Graph Options**: Visualize altitude, velocity, acceleration over time, and 3D trajectories.
- **Theme and Font Customization**: Choose between black, white, and system themes, with options to set font size and style.
- **Real-time Simulation**: Dynamic update of simulation data based on user input.

## Installation
To run this application, ensure you have Python 3.10 installed along with the following dependencies:
